# generalization-experiment


There are three experiments involved:
1. Modern risk curve for DL: `risk_curve.py` and `risk_curve_evaluate_model.py`
2. Measure intrinsic dimensions: `intrinsic_dimensions.py` and `intrinsic_dimensions_measurement.py`
3. Measure re-initialization and re-randomization robustness of layers: `layer_equality.py`
